However, some books are so influential and valuable that when you decide to study them the second time, you realize that it was the right choice, and you could make this call a few years earlier. Today I would like to show you a book that belongs to this second group — no doubts about that.</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="admonitionblock note"><table><tr><td class="icon"><i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i></td><td class="content">The two links to Amazon.com in the following blog posts are <strong>affiliate links</strong>.

Thanks for your understanding!</td></tr></table></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Introduction</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>I bought my paperback copy of <a href="https://amzn.to/2UaLwkT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>"Pragmatic Thinking and Learning"</em></a> book six years ago (March 27th, 2013), and it has blown my mind during the first read. It was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andy Hunt</a> and was published by the <a href="https://pragprog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> in 2008. It introduced me to the entirely new ways of learning, practicing and crafting technical skills, the existence of I was unaware. Like most of the people, I was blindly following unpractical learning techniques we all have learned in the school. I was consuming the content without studying and experiencing it. <em>"Pragmatic Thinking and Learning"</em> has changed me profoundly. I started questioning the traditional learning techniques, and I started benefiting from more pragmatic and practical ways of learning.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>It was one of the most influential books I read back in 2013. Six years later, in early 2019, I&#8217;ve decided to study this book again. It&#8217;s funny how many important lessons I have already forgotten. I quickly realized that getting back to this book was one of the best decisions I could make.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-03.jpg"><img src="/images/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-03.jpg" alt="pragmatic thinking and learning 03"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>What&#8217;s inside?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter one</strong> <em>(Introduction)</em> explains the importance of developing communication, learning and thinking skills. Software developers (and any knowledge workers) have to learn continuously to make good use of their abilities. This chapter also briefly describes the content of all the following chapters. <strong>Chapter two</strong> <em>(Journey from Novice to Expert)</em> uses <em>The Five Dreyfus Model Stages</em> to explain the differences between novices and experts. Those stages are:</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><strong>Novice</strong> <em>(a person who requires explicit and context-free recipes to follow)</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> <em>(a person who wants to process fast information and is not interested in the bigger picture)</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Competent</strong> <em>(a person who can troubleshoot and start solving problems he/she hasn&#8217;t faced before)</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Proficient</strong> <em>(a person who needs to understand the big picture and can self-correct their previous poor task performance)</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Expert</strong> <em>(a person who works from intuition, not from reason)</em></p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The following sections of this chapter explain how to use this model effectively to success and level-up. It also reveals that the Dreyfus Model applies to all your skills - you can be Novice in some areas, while you are <em>Proficient</em> or <em>Expert</em> in a few others.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter three</strong> <em>(This Is Your Brain)</em> focuses on our central processing unit - the brain. It describes two different processing modes: a linear mode (called <em>L-mode</em>) and non-linear mode (called <em>R-mode</em>, from <em>rich mode</em>). It explains how the brain works, how it memorizes the information, and how it works in the write-only mode all the time (each read is a read-write operation). Learning more about your brain allows you to use it more effectively. Especially the non-linear processing mode is critical in becoming an expert in a specific field. It also provides positive information - our brain is neuroplastic, so we can learn how to rewire it. <em>(An example from page 70 with a blind man blown my mind).</em></p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-02.jpg"><img src="/images/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-02.jpg" alt="pragmatic thinking and learning 02"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter four</strong> <em>(Get in Your Right Mind)</em> teaches us how to engage a non-linear processing mode to the linear one flow. It gives tons of examples and exercises on how to take advantage of the <em>R-mode</em> and how to harvest from it even more. <strong>Chapter five</strong> <em>(Debug Your Mind)</em> starts with explaining a bunch of cognitive biases that affect our perception and decision making. Some of them are influenced by the generation we have born in, or by our personality tendencies. They are also affected by so-called <em>"lizard logic"</em> - the primitive reactions that were very useful 50,000 years ago. The chapter ends with a few ideas and guidance on how to turn on the debug mode to understand better the source of our reactions to prevent (or at least limit) the destructive ones.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter six</strong> <em>(Learn Deliberately)</em> introduces a <strong>Pragmatic Investment Plan</strong> - an approach that helps to learn more effectively. It explains various learning techniques and helps to find ones that work best in our case. It describes the <strong>SQ3R</strong> reading technique, mind mapping visualizing method<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>, or <em>"Learn By Teaching"</em> approach, to name a few.</p></div><div class="admonitionblock tip"><table><tr><td class="icon"><i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i></td><td class="content"><em>"Teaching clarifies your understanding and reveals many of your underlying assumptions."</em></td></tr></table></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter seven</strong> <em>(Gain Experience)</em> explains how important it is to explore <em>("play with")</em> the learning material before studying the facts. This exploration and experience are essential to building mental models in our brain. Those models make the learning process more effective. <strong>Chapter eight</strong> <em>(Manage Focus)</em> gives several practical advice on how to increase the level of attention, manage our knowledge portfolio, and optimize the process of loading information in the current context. It covers some tips and tricks that help to stay in the "zone". <strong>The final chapter</strong> <em>(Beyond Expertise)</em> summarizes the book and recommends to <em>start with a plan</em>, <em>accept errors</em> (inaction is the real enemy), <em>recognize that developing new habits take time</em>, <em>believe in own capabilities</em>, <em>and always take small next steps.</em></p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>What are my main takeaways from this book?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>I enjoyed reading <em>"Pragmatic Thinking and Learning"</em>, but apart from that it encouraged me to do the following things:</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>I started using the <strong>SQ3R</strong> books studying technique <em>(survey, question, read, recite, review)</em> to all books I read. I already used a few other books studying techniques, but the SQ3R sounds like an approach that makes the learning process more effective.</p></li><li><p>I created my <strong>Pragmatic Investment Plan</strong> in the three key areas for my professional career. I started by <em>"reverse-engineering"</em> myself and applying the Dreyfus Model stages to several skills I want to work out. I created a concrete plan using <em>S.M.A.R.T.</em> objectives. I also researched and experimented with different ways of absorbing the knowledge and crafting experience to progress.</p></li><li><p>I decided to give the <strong>mind mapping</strong> a try. A few years ago I tried it, but I failed. This time I want to use hand-drawn mind maps with the one crucial thing in mind - <strong>the documenting</strong> is more important than documentation.</p></li><li><p>According to the minimal user interface rule I removed a few distractions from my work environment. <em>(I already practice "no notifications" principles for a couple of years).</em></p></li><li><p>I started exploring and playing around with the new things before getting deep into the details and facts.</p></li></ul></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-04.jpg"><img src="/images/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-04.jpg" alt="pragmatic thinking and learning 04"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>You may ask yourself - should I read it?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>It depends. If you have already read a few positions from the bibliography, you might not benefit much from reading the book, because you already know the things it covers. However, if you find yourself in a position where you feel stuck in the learning progression, and a portion of practical advises could give you a real shot of motivation, this book is definitely for you. When I started studying this book for the second time, I felt like I need some <em>"code review"</em> of methods and techniques I use for learning and becoming a more experienced programmer. This book offered me the guidance I needed most at the moment.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post and you have found valuable information in it. Don&#8217;t hesitate to leave a comment below if you have any question related to the book. I tried to express my feelings and opinions about it most accurately, but I accept that I might miss something important. Let me know, and I will do my best to help you find the answers you are looking for. Or maybe you have also read the <a href="https://amzn.to/2UaLwkT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>"Pragmatic Thinking and Learning"</em></a> book and you have a different opinion? Please share it with us.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve never enjoyed working with regular expressions in Java. It was always very error-prone. You had to remember to escape backslashes, and a very simple <em>match elements</em> check required writing at least 5 lines of code. Booooring. However, Groovy solved most of these issues, and today we are going to take a closer look at features like <em>pattern operator</em>, <em>find operator</em> or <em>exact match operator</em>.

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never enjoyed working with regular expressions in Java. It was always very error-prone. You had to remember to escape backslashes, and a very simple &lt;em&gt;match elements&lt;/em&gt; check required writing at least 5 lines of code. Booooring. However, Groovy solved most of these issues, and today we are going to take a closer look at features like &lt;em&gt;pattern operator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;find operator&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;exact match operator&lt;/em&gt;. We will focus on learning the new syntax, as well as measuring and comparing its performance. Let&amp;#8217;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>Today I&#8217;ve decided to improve my Github account settings a bit. I thought that it would be nice to add GPG key to it and sign all commits pushed from my computer. Everything worked great until I tried to commit the first change directly from my IntelliJ IDEA.</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="sect1"><h2>Introduction</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Why even bother with signing commits with GPG key? The most important reason is quite simple - it proves that you are the author of a given commit. Or to be more precise - the key that was used to sign this commit matches the key associated with your account. Github honors signing commits with this pretty lovely badge added to the commit history log.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/github-gpg-signing.png"><img src="/images/github-gpg-signing.png" alt="github gpg signing"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Signing git commits make even more sense if you use tools like <a href="https://keybase.io/wololock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keybase.io</a> to chat and share files in a secure (encrypted) fashion.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>How to sign Git commits?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>First of all, you need to have a GPG key. Github&#8217;s help page<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> explains in details how to generate a key, as well as how to associate it with your account. I encourage you to read it - it won&#8217;t take more than 5 minutes of your time.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Next, you need to configure your Git client to use the key. Depending on your preferences, you might want to set up GPG signing globally, or you can do it locally for a single repository. In my case, I decided to set up signing commits at the global level with the following two commands:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-bash hljs" data-lang="bash">$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true$ git config --global user.signingkey YOURKEYHERE</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>If you use Git from the command line, that is all you have to do. You can create the first commit and push it to Github to see <em>"Verified"</em> badge next to your commit history log entry.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Getting into troubles with IntelliJ IDEA</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>I assume you also use your IDE&#8217;s built-in Git client. I use IntelliJ IDEA daily, and I use its Git client a lot. When I tried to create the first commit after enabling GPG signing, IDEA&#8217;s client stopped working, and it started failing with the following error:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-plain hljs" data-lang="plain">gpg failed to sign the data fatal: failed to write commit object</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I started googling to see what the problem is. It quickly turned out that this is not the IDEA&#8217;s problem, but rather Git and GnuPG issue. It fails to sign the commit if Git command is executed without TTY, so GPG cannot prompt to ask you for a password. I&#8217;ve quickly found a solution that suggested creating an alias that executes gpg with <code>--batch --no-tty</code> options. I created a script:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 1. /usr/local/bin/gpg-no-tty</div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-bash hljs" data-lang="bash">#!/bin/bash/usr/bin/gpg --batch --no-tty "$@"</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Then I added the following block to my <code>.gitconfig</code> file.</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 2. .gitconfig</div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-bash hljs" data-lang="bash">[gpg]program = gpg-no-tty</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The solutions I&#8217;ve found promised that in this case IDEA will use <code>gpg-agent</code> that can store the password in the keyring and automatically sign the commit. Well, it didn&#8217;t work for me. At least not right away.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Fedora Linux 29 use case</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>I use Fedora Linux, and it seemed to be a critical factor in this story. I had to went through a few more articles, and I&#8217;ve finally found the answer. When I applied the solution that uses <code>--batch --no-tty</code> for the first time, it didn&#8217;t take any effect. However, it turned out that <code>gpg-agent</code> works with GPG 2.x. When I run <code>gpg --version</code> I noticed the following:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-bash hljs" data-lang="bash">$ gpg --versiongpg (GnuPG) 1.4.23Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.Home: ~/.gnupgObsługiwane algorytmy:Asymetryczne: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSASymetryczne: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256,             TWOFISH, CAMELLIA128, CAMELLIA192, CAMELLIA256Skrótów: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224Kompresji: Nieskompresowany, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>It revealed that <code>gpg</code> in my system points to version <code>1.4.23</code>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>We are software developers. Our daily duty is to write programs. We spend a lot of time and effort into doing the right things and doing them right. At some point, the production launch day comes and depending on our level of confidence - we are calm and ready for the first wave of unpredictable users, or deadly terrified.</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="sect1"><h2>Introduction</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>How to build a level of confidence that helps us releasing new versions of the system and preventing heart attacks? There is no simple answer, but there are reliable tools, techniques, and patterns every software developer should consider using. The book called <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/mnee2/release-it-second-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>"Release It! 2nd edition: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software"</em></a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mtnygard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael T. Nygard</a> covers most of them.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>What&#8217;s inside?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>In the <strong>first chapter</strong> <em>(Living in Production)</em> the author explains what does it mean that the system is production-ready and how everything that happens before the production deployment is just a prelude. He gives several short examples that illustrate how big mistake people make when they believe that any lab-sterile testing can mimic real, and often crazy, users. The <strong>second chapter</strong> is a case study - a thriller starring an unexpected exception as a villain, and a huge airline company as a victim. This chapter made me love this book. Micheal Nygard is a great storyteller, and this chapter is the best proof. He guides the reader step by step, explaining the way he analyzed and solved that problem. <strong>Chapter three</strong> <em>(Stabilize Your System)</em> focuses on defining what stability of the system means. It asks a few questions that can be summarized with "Let&#8217;s think what may go wrong" sentence. <strong>Chapter four</strong> <em>(Stability Antipatterns)</em> provides a list of possible failures, their root causes, and anti-solutions people quite often apply to solve them. In the <strong>next chapter</strong> <em>(Stability Patterns)</em> the author focuses on the simplest and most reliable solutions like timeouts, circuit breakers or backpressure to name just a few.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter six</strong> opens the second part of the book called <em>"Design for Production"</em> and it starts with the second case study, which shows how massive marketing campaign incorporated with the broken e-commerce system may cause damage. The <strong>seventh chapter</strong> <em>(Foundations)</em> introduces production-ready design layers. They are (from bottom to top): Foundation, Instances, Interconnect, Control Plane, and Operations. In this chapter the author focuses on the first layer - he briefly explains the networking basics, physical hosts, VMs and containers. The <strong>next chapter</strong> <em>(Processes on Machines)</em> uncovers the layer called "Instances". It provides the definitions of services, instances, executables, etc. It also focuses on the code (including the configuration as a code approach) and logging. In the <strong>ninth chapter</strong>, we are introduced to the instances' interconnection strategies. It starts with a simple (and error-prone) DNS-only approach and ends up with ready-to-scale service discovery solution example. <strong>Chapter ten</strong> <em>(Control Plane)</em> treats of automation, monitoring, distributed log collection, provisioning, and possible platforms that may help to achieve the desired level of control. It does not suggest any silver-bullet solution - it explains the possibilities and tells what should we focus on instead. <strong>Chapter eleven</strong> is a comprehensive tour on OWASP top 10 security vulnerabilities.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter twelve</strong> opens the 3rd part of the book called <em>"Deliver Your System"</em> and it starts with yet another case study. <strong>Chapter thirteen</strong> <em>(Design For Deployment)</em> explains the importance of smaller and more frequent deployments towards making significant changes possible with a series of small and predictable steps. The <strong>next chapter</strong> <em>(Handling Versions)</em> focuses on different ways of handling API versioning. It explains the importance of supporting backward compatible changes only and shows how to make consumer-producer integration less painful.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Chapter fifteen</strong> <em>(Trampled by Your Own Customers)</em> opens the last part of the book called <em>"Solve Systematic Problems"</em>. It starts with a case study - a history of a redesigned e-commerce system which was crashed by 250k active sessions in 30 minutes after the first launch. The <strong>next chapter</strong> <em>(Adaption)</em> teaches us how to adapt to the changing environment and grow over time through planning releases cycle. The <strong>last chapter seventeen</strong> <em>(Chaos Engineering)</em> gives a brief introduction to the idea of chaos engineering. It accepts that systems are fragile and failures show up sooner than later. And the more control over them we have, the better. Building resilient systems require breaking them regularly and in a controlled way.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/release-it-img1.jpg"><img src="/images/release-it-img1.jpg" alt="release it img1"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Conclusion</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p><em>"Release It!"</em> is a great book <strong>every</strong> software developer, architect, designer or even QA engineer should read.

Imagine you work with a Groovy code base, and all classes are annotated with the <code>@CompileStatic</code> annotation. It&#8217;s an excellent practice to favor <strong>static compilation</strong> over the dynamic one if we don&#8217;t use Groovy&#8217;s dynamic language capabilities. However, let&#8217;s say that at some point we need to compile the same source code with a static compilation disabled. There are various ways to do it. We could temporarily remove all annotations from the code, but it doesn&#8217;t sound like a good solution. Instead, let&#8217;s use a compiler configuration script to do it for us (without making a single change to the source code).</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>An example</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>We use a simple <code>Person</code> class to illustrate the use case.</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 1.

However, that is not always true, and you may find yourself in a situation where the same annotation is added using the qualified name <code>@groovy.transform.CompileStatic</code>. It affects our compiler script significantly because this annotation cannot be found using its simple name - <code>classNode.name</code> in this case returns <code>groovy.transform.CompileStatic</code>.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>How to deal with that?

However, building the final native image required installing GraalVM on our local system. Also, we may need to compile OS-specific executable every time we want to run the program on a different platform or operating system. This is where we start thinking about containerization, and today we are going to dockerize a Groovy script to play around with it.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Dockerfile</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s start with defining a Dockerfile<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.

Instead of creating and starting a new container each time we want to run a program, we can start a container, keep it running and attach and execute a command when needed. Let&#8217;s give it a try. Firstly, we run a container that executes <code>tail -f /var/log/yum.log</code> command to keep it running. We need to override entry point to do so and add <code>-d</code> option to detach from the container. We also use <code>--name</code> parameter to specify the name of this container so that we can use it instead of container ID. Next, we use <code>docker exec</code> to execute another command inside the running container.</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-bash hljs" data-lang="bash">docker run -d --name countlinks --rm --read-only --entrypoint "tail" countlinks -f /var/log/yum.logb75eef8c3a3aa696d87e284fc59600261baaf126c1fd2efc196f4df5ff9a4ee0 <i class="conum" data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>time docker exec countlinks cd /app &amp;&amp; time ./countlinks.sh https://e.printstacktrace.blogreal0m0,100s <i class="conum" data-value="2"></i><b>(2)</b>user0m0,024ssys0m0,014sWebsite https://e.printstacktrace.blog contains 96 links.real0m0,209s <i class="conum" data-value="3"></i><b>(3)</b>user0m0,021ssys0m0,008s</code></pre></div></div><div class="colist arabic"><table><tr><td><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td><td>Container ID returned when detaching from the container.</td></tr><tr><td><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i><b>2</b></td><td>Time consumed by attaching <code>docker exec</code> to the running container</td></tr><tr><td><i class="conum" data-value="3"></i><b>3</b></td><td>Time consumed by running the command inside the container</td></tr></table></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In this case, we use <code>time</code> command twice.

We see that it produces a much better result - attaching to the container takes around 110 ms. So the total execution time takes approximately <strong>300 ms average</strong>. It is still slower comparing to the result we get when running native executable outside the container, but in most cases, 110 ms is an acceptable cost.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Conclusion</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>So is it worth dockerizing GraalVM native images? It depends. If our goal is to produce an executable that completes in a blink of an eye, and where every millisecond counts - running the command inside a container won&#8217;t be the best choice. However, if this is not our case, we can benefit from dockerizing the native image. It allows us building the executable without having GraalVM or Groovy installed on the computer - it only requires Docker on board. It also makes the distribution of the executable easier - the image once created and pushed to the repository can be reused easily.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>And last but not least - dockerizing native executable means that we benefit from ahead-of-time compilation and much lower memory footprint. However, we always have to be careful when it comes to running any Java program inside the container - things like available resources (CPU, memory), secure access or networking may cause some issues. You just have to consider all pros and cons when choosing one option over another.</p></div></div></div><div id="footnotes"><hr><div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_1"><a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" class="bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/</a></div></div>]]></content>

The size of the generated native image is 50 MB, while the total size of the Groovy script and the two JAR dependencies it uses is around 5,6 MB. Also, the Groovy script you may want to compile to the native image might require some reworking to make it compatible with static compilation. So for some of the scripts, this might be not possible to do.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed reading this article and you&#8217;ve learned something useful from it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the second blog post in <em>"Programmer&#8217;s Bookshelf"</em> category, and today I would like to share with you my opinion on the <em>"Deep Work"</em> book by Cal Newport. It&#8217;s not about programming, but it&#8217;s still beneficial to any software developer out there.</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="sect1"><h2>Introduction</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>After first 2 or 3 hours of reading <a href="http://calnewport.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cal Newport</a> "Deep Work" I was under the impression that this book is a manifesto against modern world Internet-oriented society. It argues with the tendency of being always online reachable, continuously exposed to gigabytes of poor quality information, and chasing all possible updates, only because we might miss something important. "Deep Work" encourages to take a few steps back, slow down and think what the most important goals in our life are. In the introductory chapter Cal Newport explains: "This book is best described as an attempt to formalize and explain my attraction to depth over shallowness, and to detail the types of strategies that have helped me act on this attraction.". It&#8217;s important to understand that it is not a silver-bullet or apply-without-questioning kind of book. It&#8217;s author&#8217;s view on the deep work, and he explains it from the specific perspective - a computer science professor at Georgetown University.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/deep-work-book-review-img3.jpg"><img src="/images/deep-work-book-review-img3.jpg" alt="deep work book review img3"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>What is Deep Work?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>So, what kind of work is deep work? We can find, let&#8217;s say, a formal definition in the book that says: "Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.". But we can also find a more human-friendly and much better suite definition in it: the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. If we combine it with the idea of concentrating on the most important and most valuable activities for most of the time, we can see that deep work supports attempts to making our life more meaningful. I&#8217;ve read many reviews which shared the opinion, that this kind of thinking is caused by a selfish lust for power or something similar. I can&#8217;t agree with that. I see bringing more meaning to life a collaborative activity - if we can&#8217;t share our happiness or success with others, the effort we put to progress is pointless. The better we become, the better results we can produce for others.</p></div><div class="admonitionblock note"><table><tr><td class="icon"><i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i></td><td class="content"><em>"Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological."</em></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>How to practice Deep Work?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>The first rule explained in the book focuses on how to work deeply. It starts with an extreme example of Donald Knuth&#8217;s so-called "Monastic Philosophy" where he can dedicate almost 100% of his time to distraction-free and highly-focused work. This type of practice applies to a tiny amount of people worldwide, but there are three more philosophies we can put into action. The first of them called "Bimodal Philosophy" assumes that you can dedicate a significant amount of time during the year to in-depth work (e.g., one or two months a year you take a break from day-to-day practice and during that time you dedicate to the deep work only). The second of them, "The Rhythmic Philosophy" sounds most practical - every regular amount of time (e.g., every day) you dedicate some part of the day to distraction-free deep work. This philosophy is mostly applied to early morning rituals, where you can assign an hour or two to work on something that matters to you most. And the last philosophy Cal Newport describes is called "The Journalistic Philosophy" and he uses Walter Isaacson as an example of a person who can jump into in-depth work mode almost any time he gets inspired. He doesn&#8217;t rate one philosophy over another; it&#8217;s not a competition. It&#8217;s not even a closed list, and it is entirely possible that there are other techniques (or philosophies) that do the work even better. It is mostly about choosing whatever works for us best and taking the best of it.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/deep-work-book-review-img1.jpg"><img src="/images/deep-work-book-review-img1.jpg" alt="deep work book review img1"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Is "Deep Work" worth reading?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>The binary Yes/No answer is - yes. But it depends. I&#8217;ve found "Deep Work" an exciting and practical lecture because it felt like I lost the ability to work with a high level of concentration some time ago. It&#8217;s not revolutionary, and it does not present any ideas you won&#8217;t find in other books, but it still condense many useful and scientific proven information. It might look too wordy, and it could do the same job half size. Also, some of the examples are sound bizarre and very inaccurate (like the ones described with "Embrace boredom" rule). But it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that it presents valuable and useful information to any knowledge-worker.</p></div><div class="admonitionblock note"><table><tr><td class="icon"><i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i></td><td class="content">My rating on Goodreads.com - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2647838546" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4/5 stars</a></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Brain dump: 10 ideas to remember</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><p>Define what matters to you most and dedicate most of your attention to progress in these areas (career, family, relationships, personal goals).</p></li><li><p>Define what shallow work means to you and minimize the time you spent on it.</p></li><li><p>When doing a shallow job, do it effectively (e.g., batch responding to e-mails in a single time-box).</p></li><li><p>Don&#8217;t let others define your priorities.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>When I get the paperback copy of the <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/vslg2/programming-groovy-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Programming Groovy 2"</a> book back in the June 2017, I was wondering if I can find something new or exciting in the book that was written in July 2013. It took me almost 1,5 year before I have finally put the book on my desk and started reading and playing around with the examples. As a veteran Groovy developer, I have to say - it was worth it!</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="paragraph"><p>If I have to describe the book in only one sentence, I would say that "Programming Groovy 2" is the most pragmatic and gentle introduction to the Groovy programming language. Instead of explaining all possible features and use cases it focuses on the following major areas:</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>a practical introduction to the language,</p></li><li><p>using Groovy to solve day-to-day tasks,</p></li><li><p>experimenting with metaprogramming to get even more from the language.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect1"><h2>What&#8217;s inside?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>In the <strong>first part</strong> of the book, you will learn the differences between Groovy and Java. Reading this part of the book was more exciting back in the days before Java 8 because the concepts like closures or collections bulk operations had no equivalents in the raw Java language. However, it still contains a lot of important and interesting information, like dynamic typing or working with Groovy strings to name a few - something that any newcomer will appreciate and learn a lot from.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/programming-groovy-img2.jpg"><img src="/images/programming-groovy-img2.jpg" alt="programming groovy img2"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Part 2</strong> focuses on the 3 practical use cases: working with XML files, connecting and querying the database, and using Groovy as a scripting language. It also covers one funny, at least for me use case - using Groovy SQL to query Excel document through JDBC interface. I was completely unaware that you can do something like that, I just never worked with Excel documents that way. It would save me much time if I knew that a few years earlier.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Part 3</strong> introduces metaprogramming capabilities and shows various ways you can apply it for your own needs. Starting from simple method injection at the runtime, up to AST transformations applied during the code compilation phase. It explains in details Groovy&#8217;s MOP (meta-object protocol) layer, and if you ever wonder how does Groovy handle dynamic method invocation, the answer is here.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Part 4</strong> closes the book with a few extensive examples of Groovy metaprogramming in action - builders, mocking and building DSLs. The previous part gives a solid foundation to understand the language&#8217;s dynamic nature and capabilities of MOP (and its limitations). The last part of the book puts everything into action making the story complete.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Who is this book for?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/programming-groovy-img1.jpg"><img src="/images/programming-groovy-img1.jpg" alt="programming groovy img1"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venkat Subramanian</a> has his unique and effective style of teaching. I&#8217;ve read "Programming Groovy 2" after spending 7 years with Groovy, and I still found it interesting and worth reading. The book aged gracefully and even though it covers Groovy version <code>2.1.1</code>, it is still the right choice to start a journey with Groovy with it. It covers fundamental language concepts that didn&#8217;t change much since 2013. So if you want to give Groovy a chance and you are looking for a practical guide - this book is definitely for you. Also, if you are already in the ecosystem and you want to improve your understanding of the language and its powerful features, you will also find "Programming Groovy 2" an exciting lecture. Tons of practical examples, very natural and smooth writing style, and a great learning experience - and all of it in a book with 300 pages. You can work it out in one weekend with the fast pace, or you can relax and split the experience into a several 1-hour long learning sessions. Whatever works for you best.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Bonus: how did I get my copy of the book?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/programming-groovy-img4.jpg"><img src="/images/programming-groovy-img4.jpg" alt="programming groovy img4"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I got my paperback copy in June 2017. I was lucky enough to draw a book prize during <a href="http://day.torun.jug.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toruń JUG Day</a> event with Venkat Subramanian. It was the second time I had a pleasure to meet Venkat in person and spent time on talking not only programming related topics. It was such an excellent experience! Venkat is not only a great teacher but also one of the kindest person I have ever met in the tech industry.</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/programming-groovy-img3.jpg"><img src="/images/programming-groovy-img3.jpg" alt="programming groovy img3"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://spockframework.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spock Framework</a> is one of my favorite tools in the Groovy ecosystem toolbox. It makes writing automated tests a few times more pleasant thanks to its opinionated syntax. From time to time I see some corner cases where Spock behaves unexpectedly. Today I would like to show you one of these corner cases and explains what happens under the hood.</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="sect1"><h2>The basics</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Spock uses a given-when-then structure known from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behavior-driven development</a>. Its tidy syntax comes with some imposed requirements and limitations, like the one mentioned in the Spock&#8217;s documentation:<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>when</code> and <code>then</code> blocks always occur together. They describe a stimulus and the expected response. Whereas <code>when</code> blocks may contain arbitrary code, <code>then</code> blocks are restricted to <em>conditions</em>, <em>exception conditions</em>, <em>interactions</em>, and <em>variable definitions</em>. A feature method may contain multiple pairs of <code>when</code>-<code>then</code> blocks.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="paragraph"><p>It states clearly what 4 kinds of statements we can use inside <code>then</code> block. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at all of them.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h3>1. Conditions</h3><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 1. An example of the condition in the then block</div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-groovy hljs" data-lang="groovy">then:expected == result</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This is a simple expression that compares some <code>result</code> with <code>expected</code> value, which was defined most probably in the <code>given</code> or <code>setup</code> block.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3>2. Exception conditions</h3><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 2. An example of an exception condition in the then block</div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-groovy hljs" data-lang="groovy">then:thrown IllegalArgumentException</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In this example we define expectation - an exception of a specific type has to be thrown.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3>3. Interactions</h3><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 3. An example of interaction expectation in the then block</div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-groovy hljs" data-lang="groovy">then:1 * foo.bar() &gt;&gt; "Hello!"</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In this example, we say that we expect that <code>foo.bar()</code> method gets called exactly one time, and it returns <code>"Hello"</code> value.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3>4. Variable definitions</h3><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 4. An example of variable definition in the then block</div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-groovy hljs" data-lang="groovy">then:def expected = 10result == expected</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>So here&#8217;s the last available statement type - variable definition. As you can see you can define any variable inside the <code>then</code> block, however, this is not a good practice. The <code>then</code> block should be as small and smooth as possible, and this variable definition adds nothing else than noise. In some specific use cases, it might make more sense to do so, but it&#8217;s usually a better choice to consider <code>given</code> or <code>setup</code> blocks for variable definitions.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Using if-statement in the <code>then</code> block</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Now when we have recapped basic concepts of Spock&#8217;s <code>then</code> block structure, let&#8217;s take a look at some unusual example. Below you can find a simple Spock unit test that contains 3 methods. The expectation is that all of them fail because of unsatisfied assertion.</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 5. All of these test methods should fail</div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-groovy hljs" data-lang="groovy">import groovy.transform.CompileStaticimport spock.lang.Specification@CompileStaticclass SpockThenSpecialUseCase extends Specification {    def "(1) should fail on expected == result comparison"() {        given:        def expected = "Hello, John!"        when:        def result = "Hello, Joe!"        then:        expected == result    }    def "(2) should fail on expected == result comparison"() {        given:        def expected = "Hello, John!"        when:        def result = "Hello, Joe!"        then:        if (expected) {            expected == result        }    }    def "(3) should fail on expected == result comparison"() {        given:        def expected = "Hello, John!"        when:        def result = "Hello, Joe!"        then:        if (expected) {            assert expected == result        }    }}</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>When we run this test we will see the following result:</p></div><div class="openblock text-center"><div class="content"><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/spock-then-if-assertion.png}"><img src="/images/spock-then-if-assertion.png" alt="spock then if assertion"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The second test case didn&#8217;t fail as expected. The answer is clear and straightforward - if-statement does not fit to any of 4 statements we have described in the previous section.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Looking for an answer</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure this simple answer does not satisfy your pursuit to better understanding what happens under the hood. Let&#8217;s dig one level down and see what the decompiled bytecode of this class looks like.</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 6.

It works as expected when the <code>null</code> value gets wrapped with an array because we get a list with just one element - the <code>null</code> value.</p></div><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p></p><h4>15.12.4.2.

In contrast to Java&#8217;s static compilation, Groovy is a dynamically typed language by default. It means that <strong>the decision about the variable type is made in the runtime</strong>. And it makes a quite straightforward decision - the method expects an array of objects, a <code>null</code> value is passed, and for Groovy this is direct information that you consciously assigned <code>null</code> to an array. This is the price of the dynamic type system, where the context of specific usage matters.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>The solution</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>There are at least two ways you can make a Groovy example ignore the test in the same way as the Java example does.</p></div><div class="sect3"><h4>1.

Last year I did it differently. I&#8217;ve focused only on solving the puzzles with the language I use on my daily basis - Java.

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groovy has many useful functions built-in, and one of them is &lt;code&gt;Iterable.combinations()&lt;/code&gt; that takes aggregated collections and finds all combinations of items. However, if we take a look its source code, we will find out that it was implemented using very imperative approach (nested for-loops + some if-statement). In this blog post I will show you how to implement the same function using Groovy and &lt;a href=&quot;/tail-recursive-methods-in-groovy/&quot; title=&quot;tail-recursion algorithm&quot;&gt;tail-recursion algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.

It means that when server receives 500 concurrent requests to <code>localhost:8080/recommendations</code> it processes 1,000 requests that are never returned back to the client.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>Yesterday I have found this interesting question on Stack Overflow asked by <a href="https://twitter.com/czaszo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opal</a>. He faced some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/53008601/2194470" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unexpected compilation errors</a> when dealing with Java generics and Vavr library. It turned out the root cause of the issue there was not the library, but Java compiler itself. This was pretty interesting use case and it motivated me to investigate it even further. This blog post reveals untold truth about Java generics type inference. Are you ready? :)</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="sect1"><h2>An example</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s define a simple <code>Some&lt;T&gt;</code> generic class:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">import java.util.function.Consumer;import java.util.function.Supplier;public final class Some&lt;T&gt; {    private final T value;    private Some(final T t) {        this.value = t;    }    static &lt;T&gt; Some&lt;T&gt; of(final Supplier&lt;T&gt; supplier) {        return new Some&lt;&gt;(supplier.get());    }    public Some&lt;T&gt; peek(final Consumer&lt;T&gt; consumer) {        consumer.accept(value);        return this;    }    public T get() {        return value;    }}</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><code>Some&lt;T&gt;</code> represents some value provided by a supplier function. There is not much we can do we this object - its class provides only two additional methods, <code>peek(Consumer&lt;T&gt; consumer)</code> and <code>get()</code>. But that&#8217;s enough for this demo.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>There is one useful thing we would like to take advantage of - <code>peek()</code> method returns <code>Some&lt;T&gt;</code> which in this case is the reference to the caller object. This is very handy and it allows us to create a chain of methods. Let&#8217;s try it out and create <code>Some&lt;List&lt;? extends CharSequence&gt;&gt;</code> object:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 1.

Let&#8217;s modify the code a bit and use <code>peek()</code> method instead <code>System.out.println(some.get())</code>:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 2.

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I have found this interesting question on Stack Overflow asked by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/czaszo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Opal&lt;/a&gt;. He faced some &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/53008601/2194470&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;unexpected compilation errors&lt;/a&gt; when dealing with Java generics and Vavr library. It turned out the root cause of the issue there was not the library, but Java compiler itself. This was pretty interesting use case and it motivated me to investigate it even further. This blog post reveals untold truth about Java generics type inference. Are you ready? :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Median processing time per request is 1290 ms, which is OK - the longest request to product-service takes 1200 ms, so recommendations-service cannot return a response in shorter time. The longest request took 1961 ms - a decent and acceptable value in this demo.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The most interesting value is not shown directly in this result. We have executed 2000 requests to <code>/recommendations</code> endpoint and it took 7 seconds to complete all requests. However, our application handled not 2000, but 10,000 requests, because every single request to <code>/recommendations</code> causes 4&nbsp;additional requests to <code>/product/PROD-xxx</code>, handled by the same application. It means that our demo application handled ~1429 requests per second. With just a single thread.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Another good information is that handling 10,000 request didn&#8217;t cause significant resources consumption.

Keep in mind that this is not a bulletproof benchmark - I used application running with <code>gradle run</code> and I haven&#8217;t set any useful JVM tweak flags.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2>Conclusion</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Part 2 ends here.

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://micronaut.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Micronaut&lt;/a&gt; you have been probably just woken up from deep hibernation. No&amp;nbsp;worries, I&amp;#8217;m joking :) Anyway, Micronaut 1.0 GA &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/micronautfw/status/1054754150292967424&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was released yesterday&lt;/a&gt; and it is the right time to play around with it a bit. In this article I would like to show you how easy it is to handle HTTP requests in a non-blocking manner, using just a single computation thread. Interested? Let&amp;#8217;s start!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
