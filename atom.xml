    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>A few days ago I have reached 365 consecutive days on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2194470/szymon-stepniak?tab=profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow</a>. In the beginning of July 2017 I&nbsp;have decided to run an experiment - visit Stack Overflow every single day and do something useful to other community members (answer a question, review one of the queues, edit and improve existing questions and so on). Now it is the best time to summarize this experiment and share my thoughts with you.</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="sect1"><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s start with <em>"why?"</em>. I enjoy learning new things and getting better in stuff I already know. Someone could call it a pursuit of mastering programming skills. I have heard a few years back that if you want to learn something precisely, you have to know how to explain it to others.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> There is this very popular quote attributed to Albert Einstein<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>:</p></div><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p><em>If you can&#8217;t explain it simply, you don&#8217;t understand it well enough.</em></p></div></blockquote></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Even though Einstein unlikely said that, it still sounds smart enough to give this quote a try and apply it in the real life.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>So I have decided I will be watching a few tags<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> on Stack Overflow and I will try answering questions to solve people&#8217;s programming problems. I wanted to achieve this by providing clear and detailed explanation of a solution (and problem as well). I&#8217;ve focused on stuff I knew something about - things I wanted to explore deeper to get a better understanding about how things work.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="starting-point">Starting point</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>My Stack Overflow account exists since March 2013 and between 2013 and 2017 I was not very active user. My profile in the end of 2016<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup> looked like this:</p></div><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/stack-overflow-beginnings.png"><img src="/images/stack-overflow-beginnings.png" alt="stack overflow beginnings"></a></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I couldn&#8217;t get a snapshot from July 2017, but it didn&#8217;t change significantly comparing to snapshot from December 2016. Anyway, I was pretty passive SO user as you can see - I have asked a few questions, I&nbsp;have delivered some answers, but I wasn&#8217;t very consistent, especially if we take into account that I&nbsp;was a member for 4 years already.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="execution">Execution</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Now when you know what was my starting point, it&#8217;s time to reveal what my Stack Overflow daily routine looked like for the last year:</p></div><div class="ulist checklist"><ul class="checklist"><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> I have created a tag query like <code>[groovy] or [spock] or [java-stream] or &#8230;&#8203;</code> that lists only those questions I&nbsp;am the most interested in</p></li><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> I have ignored tag <code>[android]</code> that shows up pretty often with <code>[gradle]</code> tag</p></li><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> I reviewed newest questions to find something I could give an answer to</p></li><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> If I&#8217;ve found a question I found useful to other people - I upvoted it and if I was able to answer it - I tried to deliver the best answer I could give at that time</p></li><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> If I&#8217;ve found a question that was not expressed clearly - I asked for clarification and I tried to help improving the question</p></li><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> If I&#8217;ve found a question I found completely useless<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup> (like <em>I have a homework task&#8230;&#8203;</em>) - I downvoted and voted to close it</p></li><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> After reviewing newest questions I went through the review queues or I scheduled doing it later that day</p></li><li><p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> I have repeated most of these steps every single day</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="what-have-i-learned-from-this-journey">What have I learned from this journey?</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>During the last year I have participated in hundreds of Stack Overflow questions (answering, editing, commenting, voting and so on). Here are my thoughts about the things I have learned from this journey.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="1-i-don-t-have-to-chase-the-rabbit">1. I don&#8217;t have to chase the rabbit</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Many people say that getting involved in SO community these days does not make much sense, because all popular and interesting questions were already asked and it is almost impossible to earn high reputation based on questions that show up nowadays. If your goal is to chase people like Jon Skeet or even anyone who reached 100k reputation - you&#8217;re in trouble. Many highly reputable users gained their reputation with a snowball effect - they have delivered valuable answers to popular questions a few years back and they are constantly rewarded for that. I have heard that this is a&nbsp;blocker for many newcomers. I have no problem with that, because I have realized that <strong>I don&#8217;t have to compete with anyone</strong>. I focus on delivering valuable answers instead. And I won&#8217;t lie to you - I love being rewarded with reputation points or badges, but I have accepted the fact that this is only a side-effect of doing a good job, not an end in itself.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="2-there-are-many-people-waiting-for-my-help">2. There are many people waiting for my help</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>I guess you have heard about impostor syndrome.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup> I&#8217;ve found it pretty hard to overcome, especially if you are competitive by the nature and you constantly compare yourself to people that are more experienced and skilled than you, just like I did. Stack Overflow helped me hold my horses and look in the opposite direction. It became clear to me that I can learn more effectively <strong>if I help other people</strong> reaching my current level of experience. Sharing the knowledge, digging deeper in the areas I&#8217;m already familiar with and explaining these ideas with the simplest possible words boosted my learning process. And to give you a concrete example - I work with Groovy<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup> for more than 6 years already and I always saw myself as a experienced Groovy developer who knows pretty much about how things work behind the scenes. Thanks to Stack Overflow and tons of questions about different things in Groovy I have learned even more - each time I saw a question that required some sort of research from my side I jumped into it and explore it deeply enough to fully understand what&#8217;s going on. A good example of win-win situation - I have helped solving an issue and I have learned something new or I just understand the idea better.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="3-there-is-nothing-bad-in-being-wrong">3. There is nothing bad in being wrong</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>It happened to me a few times to give a wrong or partially wrong answer to the question I&#8217;ve found interesting. The good thing about Stack Overflow community is that there are people who will kindly tell you that your answer is wrong and what you can do to fix or improve it. Of course, there are a few jerks out there who will try to prove you&#8217;re stupid - simply ignore them.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="4-small-actions-repeated-consistently-produce-great-results">4. Small actions repeated consistently produce great results</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>A few months ago I have finally completed my first Stack Overflow milestone - gaining 10k reputation:</p></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1st milestone completed 🙃🏆👨🏻‍💻 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/soreadytohelp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#soreadytohelp</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/so?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#so</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/10k?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#10k</a> <a href="https://t.co/0IX3efaN4T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://t.co/0IX3efaN4T</a> <a href="https://t.co/SjxMLthAKZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/SjxMLthAKZ</a></p>&mdash; Szymon Stepniak 🧔🏻 (@wololock) <a href="https://twitter.com/wololock/status/983605216057659392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 10, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><div class="paragraph"><p>When I was starting my one year of day-to-day Stack Overflow challenge I had problems in estimating how much time will it take to reach this 10k reputation barrier. It looked to me like something that is far far away - this is why I have focused on the next small step, the next question I&nbsp;can answer and learn something from. Points, badges and other digital rewards don&#8217;t matter. Improving yourself and other people matters the most. Your reputation grows with its own pace.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s July 18th, one year and a few days later since I started my experiment. Why have I&nbsp;wrote this blog post? To brag about my progress? No. Nothing like that at all. I just want to summarize my experiment and show you that you can still actively participate in Stack Overflow community in 2018 and have a lot of fun while learning new things and mastering current skills. And many many people can learn from you writing better software every day.</p></div><div class="imageblock img-responsive img-thumbnail"><div class="content"><a class="image" href="/images/stack-overflow-now.png"><img src="/images/stack-overflow-now.png" alt="stack overflow now"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>My Stack Overflow journey is not done.

The good thing about this approach is that it does not require running the whole application and you can quickly test if the handler does what you expect. However, if you retrieve objects from Raptack&amp;#8217;s registry you will run into a problem - registry in this case is empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><p>Some time ago I was interviewed to one of the Java-based projects and I was asked to solve this pretty interesting puzzle. The question was "how to count frequency of a digit in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factorial</a> of number, let&#8217;s say 1000". I tried to solve it using Java 8 Stream API, but I guess you see how bad decision it was. Problems like that can be easily solved with pure functional languages and today we are going to find out how to solve this puzzle with Haskell.</p></div><a id="more"></a><div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s start with starting <a href="http://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GHCI</a> repl:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-text hljs" data-lang="text">~ % ghciGHCi, version 8.0.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for helpPrelude&gt;</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>We can start with calculating factorial of number 1000.

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I was interviewed to one of the Java-based projects and I was asked to solve this pretty interesting puzzle. The question was &quot;how to count frequency of a digit in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/a&gt; of number, let&amp;#8217;s say 1000&quot;. I tried to solve it using Java 8 Stream API, but I guess you see how bad decision it was. Problems like that can be easily solved with pure functional languages and today we are going to find out how to solve this puzzle with Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So what&#8217;s going on?</p></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="extending-code-groovy-lang-script-code">Extending <code>groovy.lang.Script</code></h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>First thing we need to understand is that every Groovy script is compiled to a class that extends <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/2.4.12/html/api/groovy/lang/Script.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>groovy.lang.Script</code></a>. Assuming that the script I&#8217;ve shown above is named <code>incrementing_number.groovy</code> then the compiled Java class would look like this:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">import groovy.lang.Binding;import groovy.lang.Closure;import groovy.lang.Script;import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.GStringImpl;import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.GeneratedClosure;import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.InvokerHelper;import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ScriptBytecodeAdapter;import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSite;public class incrementing_number extends Script {    Integer number;    public incrementing_number() {        CallSite[] var1 = $getCallSiteArray();        byte var2 = 0;        this.number = Integer.valueOf(var2);    }    public incrementing_number(Binding context) {        CallSite[] var2 = $getCallSiteArray();        super(context);        byte var3 = 0;        this.number = Integer.valueOf(var3);    }    public static void main(String... args) {        CallSite[] var1 = $getCallSiteArray();        var1[0].call(InvokerHelper.class, incrementing_number.class, args);    }    public Object run() {        // implementation of a run() method here    }}</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Second thing - in this example we used <code>@Field</code> annotation on purpose in line 3. According to <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/2.4.12/html/gapi/groovy/transform/Field.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class Javadoc documentation</a>:</p></div><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>Variable annotation used for changing the scope of a variable within a script from being within the run method of the script to being at the class level for the script.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The annotated variable will become a private field of the script class. The type of the field will be the same as the type of the variable. Example usage:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-groovy hljs" data-lang="groovy">import groovy.transform.Field@Field List awe = [1, 2, 3]def awesum() { awe.sum() }assert awesum() == 6</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In this example, without the annotation, variable awe would be a local script variable (technically speaking it will be a local variable within the run method of the script class). Such a local variable would not be visible inside the <code>awesum</code> method. With the annotation, <code>awe</code> becomes a private List field in the script class and is visible within the <code>awesum</code> method.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s why in compiled Java class we can find <code>Integer number</code> class field. The rest of the script body gets executed in <code>Script.run()</code> method.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="calling-closure-inside-groovy-script">Calling closure inside Groovy script</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Now let&#8217;s investigate why closure <code>body</code> increments a <code>number</code> but does not modify the variable outside the closure. First thing we need to understand is that <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html#closure-owner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every closure has an <code>owner</code></a> - an enclosing object that defines a closure. In this case <code>body.owner</code> property points to <code>incrementing_number</code> class instance. Closure ownership is also connected to delegation - Groovy&#8217;s mechanism that allows us e.g. to delegate execution of non-existing methods to other object by setting <code>obj.delegate</code> property. Groovy also defines <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html#_delegation_strategy_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delegation strategy</a> - an order in which delegation is resolved. The default strategy is <code>Closure.OWNER_FIRST</code> which is important to mention in our case.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Now we have to get back for a moment to <code>groovy.lang.Script</code> class. It overrides, inter alia, those two methods:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="title">Listing 2. <a href="https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/GROOVY_2_4_X/src/main/groovy/lang/Script.java#L54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groovy/lang/Script.java#L54</a></div><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-groovy hljs" data-lang="groovy">public Object getProperty(String property) {    try {        return binding.getVariable(property);    } catch (MissingPropertyException e) {        return super.getProperty(property);    }}public void setProperty(String property, Object newValue) {    if ("binding".equals(property))        setBinding((Binding) newValue);    else if("metaClass".equals(property))        setMetaClass((MetaClass)newValue);    else        binding.setVariable(property, newValue);}</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Groovy uses <code>getProperty(String property)</code> method any time we try to access class field and uses <code>setProperty(String property, Object newValue)</code> method any time we try to modify class field value. Our script class inherits this behavior. And because closure stored in <code>body</code> variable is owned by script class instance, reading or modifying any variable goes through those two methods.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><code>groovy.lang.Script</code> class also introduces a <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/lang/Binding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binding mechanism</a>. As you can see both <code>getProperty</code> and <code>setProperty</code> methods use <code>binding</code> field to read and store variables. When trying to read a variable that does not exist in <code>binding</code> internal variables map then it is passed to <code>GroovyObjectSupport.getProperty(String property)</code> method which returns a value associated to <code>number</code> class field. And this is the value that is passed next to <code>setProperty(String property, Object newValue)</code> method and that&#8217;s how <code>number</code> variable shows up in binding object with its initial value. When we iterate 10 times and increment <code>numbers</code> we actually increment the value hold in binding&#8217;s map and not a class field. That&#8217;s why this Groovy script shown in the beginning says in the end that:</p></div><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-plain hljs" data-lang="plain">Current number value is 15</code></pre></div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I hope this blog post will help you understanding what happens under the hood when using Closures inside a Groovy script. This post was inspired by following Stack Overflow answer: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46579944/groovy-2-4-variable-scope-in-closure-with-field-annotation/46580819#46580819" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Groovy 2.4 variable scope in closure with @Field annotation</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content>
